Resources
=========

** Figs: Illustrations has posted the figs for all but the inline emojis, which I've requested in the DCPSPROD illustrations ticket.
   13 total. (10 are informal; 3 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** PROD: Add any authors to project that need to be added.
** Syntax highlighting: applied to 739 out of 741 code listings.
** I added custom XSL to generate numbers for section headings and removed the hard-coded numbers from the text source. Xrefs aren't yet showing the section numbers, and xrefs in the PDF also aren't showing the page numbers for they sections being referenced. I'll need to modify the custom XSL to make the xrefs work as they should, and that fix has a ticket in Desk #75056.
** Ron addressed emojis the author wanted to use in code blocks by making images from the Twitter emoji set, as requested by the author. There's CSS styling these emojis in ebook and PDF formats.
** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.
